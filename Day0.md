## Step-by-Step compilation of C Program:

As per I believe compilation of C Program is not a very tedious task. But the step-by-step compilation I believe could be done and viewed on Linux very easily.

So, I took this example to demonstrate how much the analysis is easy on Linux where as a bit difficult on other OS or better say is hidden behind the GUIs which is not a good news for a Computer Science scholar.

So, let's begin with the compilation process-

In this example we are going to use an open-source compiler named GCC to compile our C program.

There are four steps to compile a C program:

1. Pre-processing

2. Compilation

3. Assembly

4. Linking

Let's see each step one-by-one:
